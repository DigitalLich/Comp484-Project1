            <h2>Land of Chaos and Balance</h2>
            <p>
                The mist and the rain of ashes have been running wild throught for thousands of years leaving the people to find
                thier own way to survive. Until 750 years ago, the sky open up for a brief moment of the day and the sun shined 
                through the ashes signaling the end of the Era of Ashes marking what is now known as the Era of Equilibrium.
                People from all the world looked at this a s hope and opportunity, and the race for power and control began.
                Nations started to rise, wars strated to brew, and conflict is still anew.

            <h2>Aentis Is...</h2>
            <p>
                An epic fantasy setting with focus in medieval society and culture, magic, and mythical creatures. It focused itself
                in to the politics of rising nations, the influence of living deities in the world, the consequences of technomagy
                rising at the same time too, and the discovery of ancient secrets sealed away for unknown reasons. <br/>
                
                It's a world where it seemes that always is a tipping balance trying to kept itself in check between chaos and order
                but not good or evil. The world is constantly revolutionizing itself, and the people must adapt to it or be left behind.
