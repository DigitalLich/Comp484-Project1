            <p>
                The creator of Aentis. Afficionado of fantasy worlds, medieval culture, and role-playing games.
                Started writing small stories since childhood and then moved to creating worlds and settings around somewhere in January 2019.
                Created 3 different worlds before Aentis, but all of them got to the point where they need to be sunset due to lack of coherence.
                Then he started to create Aentis in February 2021 with a better idea of what to do and better writing too. <br/>
                He is also a game master in a current campaing of PF2e and player in several TTRPGs, and he is currently redisigning Aentis's Myth of Creation 
                as well as several other factors of the worlds and its intricacies.

            <ul>
                <li>Books: Mistborn, Lord of the Rings, etc...</li>
                <li>Movies/TV Shows: Game of Thrones.</li>

            <h2>Philosophy</h2> 
            <p>I think one of the best sayings that help me write setting was from one of my favorite authors, where he says:</p>
            <!-- Added cite to represent a saying -->
            <blockquote cite="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/799554-though-in-this-genre-we-write-about-the-fantastic-the#:~:text=Magic%20works%20best%20for%20me,solid%20human%20emotion%20and%20experience.">
                <p>
                    Though in this genre we write about the fantastic, the stories work best when there is solid grounding in our world. 
                    Magic works best for me when it aligns with scientific principles. Worldbuilding works best when it draws from sources in our world. 
                    Characters work best when they’re grounded in solid human emotion and experience.
                </p>

                I have been following this quote ever since I heard it, and it has been splashing in all my works until now.
